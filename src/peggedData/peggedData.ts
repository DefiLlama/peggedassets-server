  mintRedeemDescription: "EURI is minted when users deposit euros with Banking Circle S.A. and is redeemed 1:1 for euros through a regulated MiCA-compliant process. Redemptions require sending EURI to a burn address; after verification and processing, the equivalent amount of EUR is transferred back to the user’s bank account. MiCA oversight ensures consumer protection, transparency, and proper reserve management throughout the minting and redemption lifecycle",
